## About The Project

This project is a Visual Studio Code extension for [Colang](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails/blob/develop/docs/user_guides/colang-language-syntax-guide.md) language.

Please note that the VScode extension currently under development is in its alpha version. This means that while it is functional to some extent, it may contain bugs, incomplete features, or undergo significant changes in future updates. Your feedback and patience during this stage are greatly appreciated as I work towards enhancing its stability and functionality.
